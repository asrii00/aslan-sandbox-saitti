2023/10/06: GitHub Pages website should be live at: https://asrii00.github.io/aslan-sandbox-saitti/index.html   

Known issues/todo:   
- Inconsistent image formatting on Pet Gallery (could be unified, might also be able to get away with larger filesizes)
- Header looks a bit different when using Firefox vs. on Chrome
- Weather widget could have time sensitive icons (moon instead of sun at night)
- Dark/light theme switcher code exists but hasn't been added



## HTML

Website contains: 
1. Basic HTML structure
1. HTML elements: headings, paragraphs, lists...
1. A HTML Form, links, and images
1. Tables (for example, the Mondrian "painting" is a table)
1. Semantic elements used throughout (header, nav, section, footer)


## CSS

Website contains:
1. Basic styling (colors, fonts)
1. Use of classes and ID's 
1. Responsive design elements (Mobile friendly)
1. Use of flexbox (in navigation & pet gallery) 
1. A sincere attempt at having a clear and user-friendly layout. "Personal website straight from 2004" happens to be my preferred website aesthetic.


## Javascript basics 

Website contains: 
1. Simple interactions (alert, button click event) (Contact page)
1. Multiple event listeners (change, focusout, etc) and basic DOM manipulations (On all pages except Gallery)
1. Use of arrays, objects and functions (Index page)
1. Advanced logic, forEach loop and dynamic DOM updates (About page)
1. Object-Oriented JavaScript principles: classes and objects, inheritance (extends), private method, polymorphism (Index page: the update banner and personal info table)


## Asynchronous operations 
1. A timer is used (Index -> lightbulb. It has a semi-randomized on duration.)
1. A Fetch call is implemented (data for Pet Gallery on the About page is fetched from a json file + weather data)
1. Data from the asynchronous call is displayed on the webpage (Pet Gallery + weather data)
1. Basic error handling for Fetch (About page)
1. Filtering (Pet Gallery on About page)



## Easter eggs to find
1. Evil cat
1. OwO
1. High standards 
1. The one that only makes sense if you've met me in real life
